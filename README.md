# Groovy Implicit Type Conversion Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Groovy related to implicit type conversion and the limitations of using `instanceof` for type checking.  The `bug.groovy` file contains a function that attempts to handle different input types, but its type checking is not robust enough to handle all edge cases. The `bugSolution.groovy` shows the improved version.

## Problem

Groovy's flexible type system can lead to unexpected behavior when using `instanceof` for type checking, especially when dealing with complex or nested data structures. The provided example shows how a seemingly simple type check can fail to catch unexpected input types.

## Solution

The solution uses Groovy's `is` operator for type checking which handles subclassing more gracefully, and it uses more robust input type handling.
